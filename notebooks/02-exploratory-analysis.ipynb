       "array(['Mouth breathing is associated with increased airway resistance, pharyngeal collapsibility, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity. It is commonly believed that closing the mouth can mitigate the negative effects of mouth breathing during sleep. However, we propose that mouth breathing serves as an essential route bypassing obstruction along the nasal route (e.g., velopharynx). The present study investigates the role of mouth breathing as an essential route in some OSA patients and its association with upper airway anatomical factors.\\n\\nParticipants underwent drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) with simultaneous pneumotach airflow measurements through the nose and mouth separately. During the DISE procedure, alternating mouth closure (every other breath) cycles were performed during flow-limited breathing.\\n\\nWe evaluated the overall effect mouth closure on inspiratory airflow, and the change in inspiratory airflow with mouth closure across three mouth-breathing quantiles. We also evaluated if velopharyngeal obstruction was associated with mouth breathing and a negative airflow response to mouth closure.',\n",

       "       'This Stage II randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial seeks to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and effects of a driving decision aid use among geriatric patients and providers. This multi-site trial will (1) test the driving decision aid (DDA) in improving decision making and quality (knowledge, decision conflict, values concordance and behavior intent); and (2) determine its effects on specific subpopulations of older drivers (stratified for cognitive function, decisional capacity, and attitudinally readiness for a mobility transition). The overarching hypotheses are that the DDA will help older adults make high-quality decisions, which will mitigate the negative psychosocial impacts of driving reduction, and that optimal DDA use will target certain populations and settings.',\n",
