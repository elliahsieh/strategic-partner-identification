# Strategic Partner Identification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying potential business partners for a sleep apnea diagnostic device by analyzing clinical trials from various medical fields. The primary focus is on trials related to sleep apnea, while also considering studies in conditions such as obesity, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes. The objective is to target both current collaborators in sleep apnea diagnostics and those who may enter this field in the future.

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) and downloaded on **September 16, 2024**.

## Research Methodology

1. **Phase 1**: Analysis of clinical trials directly related to sleep apnea to identify companies currently involved in diagnostics or treatments.
2. **Phase 2**: Broader analysis of trials in related fields, including obesity, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes, to identify companies with potential future interest in sleep apnea.
3. **Filtering Criteria**: Prioritization of trials involving commercial sponsors, ongoing studies, and those focused on diagnostic devices or relevant interventions.
4. **Outcome**: The goal is to compile a comprehensive list of companies engaged in or potentially expanding into sleep apnea diagnostics or treatment.
